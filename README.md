# FileTimeChanger
File Time Changer is a simple Golang application to change the time modified of
any file on a system. This native-go application uses 0 external dependancies, 
meaning all the code that I have written only uses official go packages.
**Note: This project has only been tested on OSX**

## Motivation
Back in high school, I was having a conversation with my computer science
teacher about file timestamps and he mentioned that it is possible to modify
file timestamps. Fast forward to my internship in San Francisco during the
summer of 2019 and while I was on my commute home thinking of a side project to
write that moment popped into my head. With no other 'better' ideas and with an
eagerness to improve on my golang skills I decided to use that conversation as
my motivation to improve my golang skills.
